<section>
  <h1>What is Git?</h1>
	<p>&#147;Git is a free & open source, distributed version control system designed to handle everything
	from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."</p>
	<aside>http://git-scm.com/</aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>What is Git? (cont'd.)</h1>
	<p>
	A little history...
	<ul>
	<li>First there was RCS</li>
	<li>Then there was CVS</li>
	<li>And then there was Subversion</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>What is Git? (cont'd.)</h1>
	<p>Whereas Subversion was created to be "A Better CVS",
	Git is&mdash;to coin a
	phrase&mdash;<em>magical
	and revolutionary.</em></p>
	</p>
</section>




<section>
  <h1>Benefits of Git</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Git makes your life easier</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Offline commits</li>
		<li>Cheap branching and merging (So easy you'll actually use them)</li>
		<li>More flexible workflows</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Data redundancy and replication.
		<span class="unhighlightbt">Since there are multiple full repos on multiple machines (instead of one central repo), the risk of project loss is lower.</span></li>
	<li>High availability. <span class="unhighlightbt">Server down? Network down? No problem. Work in your repo (commit, view history, branch etc) to your heart's content. Try that with Subversion!</span></li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>
<section>
	 <h1>Benefits of Git (cont'd.)</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>Only one .git directory <em>per repository</em>. (Versus a .svn in every subfolder)</li>
	<li>Superior disk utilization and network performance</li>
	<li>Properties such as ignores are <em>much easier to manage</em></li>
	<li>Much more</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Real world stats</h1>
	<p>
	A very large (lots of code, long history) repository, real-world SVN vs Git metrics:
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>SVN much bigger disk hog (On the order of 200 times bigger!)</li>
	<li>SVN much slower across network</li>
	<li>Sorry to be vague. See my May 19th email for details.</li>
	</ul>
</section>




<section>
  <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Git is distributed &mdash; Each repo is <em>the full repo</em>; a peer of every clone</li>
	<li>Changes are committed <em>locally</em> <span class="unhighlightbt">(versus committing to a central server, a la Subversion)</span></li>
	<li>Collaborative code is shared via push & pull</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Key Concepts (cont'd.)</h1>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Branching and merging is easy and useful</li>
	<li>Revision identifiers are hashes of the full tree, not sequential versions like SVN's.
	<span class="unhighlightbt">For example, the current revision of this presentation is 8b328d08f212ab855906a56ec921b3a996a5c85c.
	Fortunately, you can refer to it in commands with a unique substring, eg 8b32.</span></li>
	<li>Where you are in the tree is more complicated than in SVN (Out of scope)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Key Concepts (cont'd.)</h1>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Changes are <em>staged</em> then committed</li>
	<li>Git tracks content, not metadata. It tracks changes in the tree, not files or directories. (Sub-file tracking.)</li>
	<li>If you want collaborators to receive your changes, push your
	commits to a &#147;rendezvous" repository on a server you can both access</li>
	<li>To receive collaborators' commits, pull commits from the &#147;rendezvous" repository</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<aside>[1] There are other ways to collaborate (eg. via patches, pulling and pushing directly between peers, etc) but the rendezvous server method is the usual practice.</aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Key Concepts (cont'd.)</h1>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Don't be lulled into a false sense of confidence. Many concepts in Git correspond to concepts in SVN, but it's critical to grok the fundamental differences
	between Git and SVN. Elsewise, trouble ensues.</li>
	<li>Fortunately, it doesn't take long.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h1>A Quick Word About the Commands</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>
  At first, Git commands can look intimidating. &#147;So many commands! My brain is exploding!"
  </li>
  <li>
  Fortunately,
  Git is a bit like Unix&mdash;Though there's a ton of commands you <em>can</em> use, you'll be 
  productive with just a small handful.
  </li>
  <li>As you'll see, the typical daily workflow requires mastery of very few commands.</li>
  <li>
  Don't be afraid. Let's look at a simple example...
  </li>
  </ul>
</section>



<section>
  <h1>A simple example</h1>
  <p>Say your project is comprised of an HTML file with some CSS.</p>
  <p>Let's make a git repo.</p>
</section>




<section>
  <h1>Creating the repo</h1>
  <p>It's easy!</p>
  <p>First, let's create a directory and some files. (This isn't git stuff yet.)</p>
  <pre class="brush:js class-name:l16">
	$ mkdir foo // create a new directory for the project
	$ cd foo // navigate to that directory
	$ touch README page1.html  // create the files
  </pre>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Creating the repo (cont'd.)</h1>
  <p>Now let's create the git repository and commit. Three easy steps:</p>
<pre class="brush:js class-name:l16">
	$ git init . // initialize a new Git repository
	$ git add . // add the current directory and its contents to the git staging area
	$ git commit -a -m "initial commit" // commit!
</pre>
	<p>That's it!</p>
	<p>You've created a new Git repository and performed your first commit.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Creating the repo (cont'd.)</h1>
	<h2>A little tip</h2>
	<p>Creating a new Git repo is <em>trivially easy</em>.
	Because it's so easy (just a few seconds of effort) you can freely experiment.
	Want to know what effect a git amend will have on your squashed merge but don't want to find out the hard way in your real repo? Spin up
		a new repo and try it out.</p>
</section>


<section>
	<h1>Making a few changes</h1>
	<p>Add some basic content to the file. (Hope you have snippets!)</p>
	<pre class="brush:js class-name:l16">
		&lt;html&gt;                
		&lt;head&gt;                
		        &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;

		        &lt;title&gt;Page1&lt;/title&gt;
		        &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;
		                body {
		                        background: red;
		                }   
		        &lt;/style&gt;   
		&lt;/head&gt;               
		&lt;body&gt;                
		        i am master                                                       
		&lt;/body&gt;               
		&lt;/html&gt;
  </pre>
	<p>Save your changes, load the page in Safari, and behold the redness.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Making a few changes (cont'd.)</h1>
	<p>See your changes:</p>
	<pre class="brush:js class-name:l16">
		$ git status // like svn status
		$ git diff --color // totally cooler than svn diff
</pre>
	<p>Commit these new changes:</p>
		<pre class="brush:js class-name:l16">
			$ git commit -a // -a adds the changes to staging. And yes, you can git commit -a -m "message"
</pre>
	<p>View history:</p>
		<pre class="brush:js class-name:l16">
			$ git log // gui example: gitk
</pre>
<p>You mentioned staging. What's that?</p>
</section>

	
<section>
  <h1>Staging</h1>
  <ul>
	<li>Files are added to the staging area and then committed.</li>
	<li>You can add multiple changes in multiple files to staging before committing.</li>
	<li>(Actually, git doesn't care about your so-called files, puny human. The tree is all!)</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="width:513px;padding-top:1em" class="smaller">
	<div style="width:300px;">
        <img style="display:block;margin:0.4em auto 0" src="images/wd_stage_history.png" alt="git">
    </div>
</section>


<section>
	<h1>Make a few more changes</h1>
	<p>Let's make a change to the css so we can see a simple change.</p>
	<p>Add the following two lines (or similar) to the style and change the background color to blue:</p>
<pre class="brush:js class-name:l16">
	background: blue;
	color: #fff;
	font-size: 500%;
</pre>
	<p>Save, then reload in Safari and behold the change.</p>
	<p>Inspect with your shiny new git commands, and then commit:</p>
	<pre class="brush:js class-name:l16">
	$ git diff --color // NOTE: the old background line is red, and the new one is green
	$ git commit -a
	$ git log
</pre>
</section>





<section>
	<h1>Branching</h1>
	<h2>Why branch at all?</h2>
	<ul>
			<li>Scenario: Working in an experimental branch. Ah... freedom!</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Like it? Merge it</li>
				<li>Hate it? Delete branch</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Scenario: The "inconvenient bug" scenario</li>
			<ol>
				<li>You're happily working in a branch when a P1 bug occurs in master</li>
				<li>In an instant, you switch to master, and fix the bug</li>
				<li>Switch back to your branch, and you're right where you left off</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Branching (cont'd.)</h1>
	<h2>&#147;Branches are cheap and easy? Prove it"</h2>
	<p></p>
